They contain many features that aren't relevant or useful to a herbal medicine specialist, and it is often costly to pay for ongoing prescriptions. 

The aim of this app is to provide a solution that is niched towards simple recording of patient data and prescriptions, with a specialised focus on Chinese Medicine herbal formulas. It is a simple and affordable solution for Chinese medicine herbalists. 

## Why this problem needs solving
Chinese medicine practitioners are often sole practitioners, and do not have the resources to invest in expensive software. They are often looking for a simple and affordable solution to record their patient data and prescriptions.

## Why is PostgreSQL the database of choice? And what are the drawbacks compared to others?

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system. It is a great choice for this project because it is free and open-source, and it is also a very powerful database. It is also a great choice because it is a relational database, which is a great fit for this project. Additionally, it is a very scalable database, which is important for a project that is expected to grow in the future.

(“Advantages of PostgreSQL - CYBERTEC | Data Science & PostgreSQL,” n.d.; PostgreSQL Advantages, n.d.)

In comparison to other databases, some known drawbacks of PostgreSQL include: 

- Slower speeds: while usually not a huge issue, PostgreSQL can be a little slower than other database systems, especially for complex queries and large datasets.

- Less support for non-relational data: PostgreSQL is a relational database, and is not as good at handling non-relational data as other databases.

## What are the key functionalities and benefits of an ORM? 

An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper. It is a tool that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm. It is a great tool for developers because it allows them to interact with a database using an object-oriented paradigm, which is a more intuitive way of interacting with a database. It also allows developers to interact with a database without having to write SQL queries. Additionally, it allows developers to interact with a database without having to worry about the underlying database structure.
